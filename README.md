Test Strategy

With the ‘help’ section provided by 'WordPress' in their online platform, I have discerned the necessity for a comprehensive Functional Testing regimen tailored to the functionalities delineated in the "Test items" section. The strategic approach to this testing initiative encompasses:
•	Test Design: Systematic development of test scenarios that encapsulate the diverse functionalities within the testing scope.
•	Test Case Formulation: Rigorous creation of detailed test cases derived from the aforementioned scenarios, ensuring a holistic evaluation of each feature.
•	Execution Strategy: Leveraging advanced automated testing tools and methodologies to ensure precision and efficiency in the testing efforts.

In the pursuit of ensuring comprehensive coverage and accuracy, the testing strategy will harness a blend of established and innovative Test Design techniques:

1. Structured Techniques:
1.	Equivalence Class Partitioning: Segmenting input data into equivalent classes to minimize redundancy.
2.	Boundary Value Analysis: Focusing on the edge values of input domains to identify potential anomalies.
3.	Decision Table Testing: formulating test cases based on logical conditions and their corresponding outcomes.
4.	State Transition Testing: Evaluating system behavior across different input conditions and transitions.
5.	Use Case Testing: Simulating real-world scenarios to ensure end-to-end functionality.

2. Heuristic Techniques:
   
1.	Error Guessing: Leveraging our expertise to predict potential error-prone areas and creating test cases accordingly.
2.	Exploratory Testing: Empowering testers to dynamically explore and assess the application's behavior.

3. Test Case Prioritization: To optimize our testing efforts and ensure timely identification of critical issues, we will prioritize test cases based on their significance and potential impact.
   
Structured Testing Workflow

1.	Preliminary Assessment: Upon receiving an application build, our initial step is to conduct a Smoke Test. This ensures that the core functionalities are operational, and the build is stable enough for further examination.
2.	Build Acceptance: Should the Smoke Test reveal critical issues, we'll promptly reject the build, deferring comprehensive testing until a more stable iteration is provided.
3.	Detailed Analysis: Once a stable build clears the Smoke Test, we delve into meticulous testing using our predefined test cases.
4.	Parallel Testing: To ensure compatibility and consistency, multiple testers will evaluate the application across various supported environments concurrently.
5.	Defect Management: Identified issues are logged in our defect tracking system. Additionally, a daily status report detailing the discovered defects is saved.

Testing Spectrum: The testing approach encompasses:

•	Smoke and Sanity Testing: Initial assessment of core functionalities.
•	Regression and Retesting: Ensuring modifications don't introduce new issues and verifying bug fixes.
•	Usability, Functionality, and UI Testing: Evaluating user experience, feature completeness, and interface aesthetics.

Best Practices for Enhanced Testing

1.	Context-Driven Testing: Our testing approach is tailored to the unique context and requirements of each application.
2.	Shift-Left Testing: We initiate testing early in the development lifecycle, ensuring early detection and resolution of issues rather than awaiting a finalized build.
3.	Exploratory Testing: Beyond structured test case execution, our team leverages their expertise for dynamic, uncovering potential edge cases and anomalies.
4.	End-to-end workflow: Our approach will encompass evaluating the entire user experience, ensuring seamless integration and interaction across multiple functionalities, thereby replicating real-world user scenarios.

Defect Management Approach:

During Test Execution:

1.	Anomaly Identification: Any deviation from the anticipated application behavior will be meticulously documented. If it doesn't qualify as a defect, it will be cataloged as an observation or raised as a query for further clarification.
2.	Usability Assessment: Issues affecting the user experience or interface intuitiveness will be duly reported.
3.	Defect Verification: Upon pinpointing a potential defect, its reproducibility will be verified. Detailed documentation, inclusive of screenshots and step-by-step reproduction procedures, will be maintained.
4.	Daily Reporting: At the culmination of each testing day, a comprehensive report of identified defects, along with observations, will be saved for review.

Documentation:

1.	Defect Tracking: All identified defects will be systematically recorded in an Excel spreadsheet and Xray integrating Jira, ensuring structured and accessible data management.
2.	Test Documentation: Both test scenarios and test cases will be meticulously documented in a dedicated Excel workbook and Xray integrating Jira, facilitating clarity and traceability.
